        and computers of course.</p>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning code a while ago as of start to think that this proficiency is by far more suitable for me than my current procurement job. Having started
          with Python, I have also learned a bit web designing after learning HTML & CSS.</p>

        <h3>Driven & Planful</h3>
        <p>No matter how hard or long the process is, I find a way and complete it if I am really have enthusiast of it. In case the project is complicated and slow,
        I create a project schedule and divide the project into small tasks. Afterwards, it can be handled smoothly together with some patience and perseverance. </p>
